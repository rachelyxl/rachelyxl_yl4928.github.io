<h2>To find whether fruits are reordered more frequently than vegetables.</h2>
<pre class="r"><code>instacart_fruits =

  count(reordered == &quot;1&quot;) %&gt;% 
  knitr::kable()</code></pre>
<p>Based on two tables that I made regarding the <code>reordered</code> of <code>fresh fruits</code> and <code>fresh vegetables</code>, it is obvious that the rate of reordering <code>fresh fruits</code> is <code>110782/(110782+39691) = 0.736</code>; the rate of reordering <code>fresh vegetables</code> is <code>91368/(91368+59241) = 0.607</code>. Since <code>0.763 &gt; 0.607</code> It is true that fruits are reordered more frequently than vegetables.</p>

    order_number &gt; 25,
   aisle == &quot;fresh vegetables&quot;) %&gt;% 
  filter(grepl(&quot;Organic&quot;, product_name))</code></pre>
<p>The data that I chose from the instacart are <code>fresh vegetables</code> which were reordered and has the <code>order_number</code> larger than <code>25</code> and belong to the <code>department</code> of <code>produce</code>. Also, I chose the <code>fresh vegetabels</code> which are <code>organic</code>.</p>
